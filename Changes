TAP v0.1 now enters maintenance status.  Its code
will co-exist with @version 0.2 in this worktree,
however beware that not all files apply everywhere.

0.2_01   2025 Apr 07
exec() is now split into plan(int[]), run() / runff()
How? Why? read howto/ver0.2.txt to find out...

XXX: runff() was meant for jdb(1) but i have no idea how
to enter stack frames.  probably don't count on it... :(

This is a second attempt that shifts away from the
model of inheritance.  It tries to separate the test
runner from the tests themselves.  The minor version
bump is there not only because this is a new week
project, but also that, as you can imagine, it is
essentially incompatible with the embedded version.

This is also where I will try to stabilize the API,
so there will be greater promises... though for now it
will be an alpha for myself (and maybe people?) to try.

This was a first attempt at reorganizing test code.
Most prominently, there is now exec () that supports
testing classes that are not ours.  Several utility
methods like note (), skip () and fail () for a variable
number of tests, and (with some reluctance) is () are
added as well.  It has been added as src/body.java and
can be generated using `./gen-embed CLASSNAME'.  An
example using this can be found in `BinarySearchTree.java',
which has been written from scratch exclusively for the
purpose of demonstration.

0.1      2025 Jan 26 - 29
The initial versions of `TAP for Java' was
embedded throughout Binary Search Tree classes.
There is little worth in revisiting these, as they
rely on very much hard-coded stuff.
